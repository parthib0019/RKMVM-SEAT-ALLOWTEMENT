1. Back buttons works oddly , either not responding or not discarding the prev data like it should.

2. Add a preview button on the last (download page) to help user tally o/p with I/p. why? - when some rooms are small and by chance roll input is larger, itll discard the ones it cant allocate in that room.

2A. maybe we could give it the option to overflow into the next given input room or suggest a room for the problem to the user(a dept/year however must sit in one room)

2B. dynamically show user how many rolls are getting and how many seats are left for filling. aka dynamically adjust capacity.

3. should keep only 1 back button.

4.back doesn't delete the lower table data.

5.common data > no of depts > dept m of n > save > back > no of depts > start inputting data.

    triggers ISSUE of dept n+1 of n. but limit is to n so. WRONG.
