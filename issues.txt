1. Back buttons works oddly , either not responding or not discarding the prev data like it should.--

2. Add a preview button on the last (download page) to help user tally o/p with I/p. why? - when some rooms are small and by chance roll input is larger, itll discard the ones it cant allocate in that room.--UNRESOLVED

2A. maybe we could give it the option to overflow into the next given input room or suggest a room for the problem to the user(a dept/year however must sit in one room)---UNRESOLVED

2B. dynamically show user how many rolls are getting and how many seats are left for filling. aka dynamically adjust capacity.--UNRESOLVED

3. should keep only 1 back button.--solved

4.back doesn't delete the lower table data.

5.common data > no of depts > dept m of n > save > back > no of depts > start inputting data.

    triggers ISSUE of dept n+1 of n. but limit is to n so. WRONG.--solved
