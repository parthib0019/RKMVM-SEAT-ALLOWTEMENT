can you impliment those updates:
1. see in my html script after fulling up the fields: Date, Paper Name, Year, Subject, Subject Type, Separation it will sent all the data
to the servers end point "/roomSuggestion" and the endpoint return something along with a list of rooms but the script(js) is not useing and showing the suggestion
at the dorp down of Room Number(s): in the dorp down.
can you make it for me?

2. also make the js like that if the total capacity of those chosen rooms are greater that equals to (4*total students)[if separation is 1]
 and (9*total students)[if separation = 2], then the user can submit or it will show him error.

3. one more thing that the server is sending the data of total student so if also maintain the data of all all rooms in a same date of it is full then don't show it in the next input section.

4. the paper Name of two section can not be same.

5. if for a input{i} a roll numbe is selected and he is assigned a seat then the same roll number is not possible to be taken at the same date for the next input.
